<h3>We chose the Brazillian flag -</h3>
<body>We chose this flag as it had lots of different shapes and colours which we could play with and manipulate.</body>

<h3>Own flag design -</h3>
<body>We then had to create our own flag, either imaginary or real.</body>

<body>I chose to create my hometown's flag... seems as it  didn't have one! I got my insperation from the town's local [football team kit](http://www.mtfc.co.uk/cms_images/2013-home-and-away-kit289-1009511_478x359.jpg), and using the symbol of a peice of bread to represent the famous brand: HOVIS. 

Hovis bread originated in Macclesfield and has kept the same recipe since it first opened in 1898. Although I could have chosen more symbolic references to Macclesfield, such as its most popular nickname - "Silktown" as it was once the *biggest producer of finished silk in the country* or "Treacletown", as once a horse-drawn carriage overturned and spewed tons of treacle on to the road, and the poor scooped it up... <strong>BUT</strong> the bread was an easier symbol to draw and remember. </body>
